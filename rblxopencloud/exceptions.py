    | Status | Exception | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 400 Bad Request | [`HttpException`][rblxopencloud.HttpException] \
    | The request body is malformed or not valid. Some methods will return \
    a specific error instead of \
    [`HttpException`][rblxopencloud.HttpException]. |
    | 401 Unauthorized | [`HttpException`][rblxopencloud.HttpException] \
    | The API key or OAuth2 bearer token is invalid, has expired, not from \
    an accepted IP, or the API has been been enabled for the key. |
    | 403 Forbidden | [`Forbidden`][rblxopencloud.Forbidden] \
    | The authorization doesn't have access to the requested resource. |
    | 404 Not Found | [`NotFound`][rblxopencloud.NotFound] \
    | The resource or endpoint could not be found. |
    | 429 Rate Limited | [`RateLimited`][rblxopencloud.RateLimited] \
    | The resource is being rate limited. |
    | 5xx Server Error | [`HttpException`][rblxopencloud.HttpException] \
    | The server ran into an internal error and is unable to process the \
    request. |
    | Other Error Statuses | [`HttpException`][rblxopencloud.HttpException] \
    | The server returned an unexpected HTTP status. |

    Functions in the library that raise different exception from those above \
    will be documented in the method itself.
