# Migrating to v2

## What's new in v2?

- Asynchronous version of the library
- Ability to send HTTP requests for unimplemented endpoints with [`send_request`][rblxopencloud.send_request]
- Better syntax for uploading assets
- Support for new APIs: Memory Store (alpha), Subscriptions, Notifications, Group Join Requests, Assets v2, Experience and User Info, and Restart Servers
- Some new methods to simplifiy certain parts of code

## Updating the library
=== "Windows"
    ```console
    py -3 -m pip install rblx-open-cloud --upgrade
    ```

=== "Linux"
    ```console
    python3 -m pip install rblx-open-cloud --upgrade
    ```

## Breaking Changes

There are a few breaking changes between v1 and v2 which require changes in existing v1 code to be compatible with v2. This guide will demonstrate all these changes.

### Datastore methods renamed

The following methods have had `_entry` appended to them `get`, `set`, `increment`, `remove`. For example take the following code:

```py
value, info = datastore.get("287113233")
datastore.remove("287113233")
```

Would be rewritten as:
```py
value, info = datastore.get_entry("287113233")
datastore.remove_entry("287113233")
```

Additionally, `get_data_store` has been renamed to `get_datastore`, `list_data_store` has been renamed to `list_datastore`, and `get_ordered_data_store` has been renamed to `get_ordered_datastore`.

### `upload_place` moved and renamed

upload_place has been moved from [`Experience`][rblxopencloud.Experience] to [`Place`][rblxopencloud.Place] and renamed to [`Place.upload_place_file`][rblxopencloud.Place.upload_place_file]. The following code would be modified from:

```py
experience.upload_place(000000, file)
```

To this derivative:
```py
place = experience.get_place(000000)
place.upload_place_file(file)
```

### `upload_asset` and `update_asset` now returns [`Operation`][rblxopencloud.Operation]

To simplify the process of uploading assets, asset upload requests now return an [`Operation`][rblxopencloud.Operation]. This means this lengthly code:

```py
asset = creator.upload_asset(...)

if isinstance(asset, rblxopencloud.Asset):
    print(asset)
else:
    while True:
        status = asset.fetch_status()
        if status:
            print(status)
            break
```

Can be shortened to:

```py
asset = creator.upload_asset(...).wait()
```

### `user_id` parameter of [`list_members`][rblxopencloud.Group.list_members] removed

For simplicity, [`list_members`][rblxopencloud.Group.list_members] no longer accepts a `user_id` parameter. To fetch a specific member of a group, use [`fetch_member`][rblxopencloud.Group.fetch_member] instead.

### Exception changes

The following exceptions have been renamed/merged:

- `rblx_opencloudException` -> [`BaseException`][rblxopencloud.BaseException]
- `InvalidKey` -> [`HttpException`][rblxopencloud.HttpException]
- `PermissionDenied` -> [`Forbidden`][rblxopencloud.Forbidden]
- `ServiceUnavailable` -> [`HttpException`][rblxopencloud.HttpException]
- `InsufficientScope` -> [`HttpException`][rblxopencloud.HttpException]
- `InvalidAsset` -> [`InvalidFile`][rblxopencloud.InvalidFile]

Note that some breaking changes may not be documented. Please report any that are missing.
